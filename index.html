<h2 align="middle">Abstract</h3>

<p>
  In this project, we simulate the effects of wind on grass. Our project consists of a few major segments. First, we built the wind simulation and tested it on a pinned cloth. We were able to build a fairly realistic wind field that accurately moves the simulated cloth, and we would later tailor this wind field to our grass object. Next, we set out to build that grass object and simulate the wind’s effect on it. This involved calculating the forces on the grass, using Euler integration to calculate the angular displacement, and doing 3D rotation based on the displacement. After the simulation phase, we built the grass shaders to make the grass more visually accurate. We also did some shading to help visualize the wind’s point of origin by displaying a rectangle that is tangent to it, facing the grass.
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Technical Approach</h3>
  <h3>Our starting point</h3>
<p>
  We began with the project 4 skeleton and built the grass within it. This means our grass structure utilizes the same point mass objects from the skeleton, and the grass simulator pipeline is similar to that of the cloth simulator.
</p>
<h3>The basis of our wind force</h3>
<p>
  We made a few alterations to the wind simulation from our original plans. Rather than basing our simulation off of fluid dynamics, we decided to go with a fixed wind field and alter the force during the grass simulation step. We decided to base our wind force calculations on 'wind load', which is typically calculated to determine the effect of high winds on a building/structure. We felt that using wind load as the force was similar to (and could be easily substituted for) equation 4 in the main paper that we referenced, which uses a fluid wind force. To calculate the wind load, we used the following equations: <br><br>
  <b>F<sub>x</sub></b> = Dynamic Pressure &bull; (width &bull; height) &bull; cos(windAngle)<br>
  <b>F<sub>y</sub></b> = 0 <br>
  <b>F<sub>z</sub></b> = Dynamic Pressure &bull; (width &bull; height) &bull; sin(windAngle)<br>
  <div style="text-indent: 3em">where Dynamic Pressure = Air Density &bull; windVelocity</div><br>

  <b>Air Density</b> is 1.22 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, which is the density at sea level. <b>Wind velocity</b> and <b>wind angle</b> are obtained via sliders in the GUI. <b>Width</b> and <b>height</b> are obtained through JSON parameters for the scene. To implement the new GUI elements, we added a struct to the skeleton called WindParameters which functions similarly to ClothParameters, making the GUI input values readily available to our grass simulation functions.<br><br>
  As demonstrated in the equations above, the wind affects point masses in the z and x directions, but it does not affect the y direction. This is a simplification we make due to the fact that our grass is, for the most part, oriented vertically on a horizontal plane. The given equations for F are the basis of our wind force, but we adjust the force vector in our grass simulation to make it seem more realistic.
  <h3>Tweaking the wind force to appear more realistic in the grass simulation</h2>
  We adjust the wind force directly by applying a coefficient that decreases in proportion to a point mass' distance from the wind origin. Before showing the equation for this coefficient, we should first define the <b>wind origin</b>. <br><br>
  <div style="text-indent: 2em">
  <code>windOrigin = Vector3D(width / 2 + width * cos(windAngle), halfBladeHeight, height / 2 + width * sin(windAngle));</code>
  </div><br>
  The wind origin is the point at windAngle degrees, along a circle that surrounds and extends up from the grass' xz plane. The circle's origin is at the center of the grass plane and shifted up to half a blade's vertical height, and its radius is the length of the plane.<br><br>
  <div style="text-indent: 2em">
  <code>windDistanceFactor =  0.5 + (1 / (point_masses[i].position - windOrigin).norm());</code>
  </div><br>
  The coefficient is fairly simply and its only purpose is to scale down the wind force exerted on a point the further away it is from the wind origin (and to increase wind force on points close to the wind source). This coefficient gives the impression that the grass is moving according to a time-variable wind force, since the coefficient will decrease as the grass is pushed further away over time.
<h3>The structure of each grass blade</h3>
<p>
  We have gone over the external forces that will ultimately interact with and move our grass blades. However, before we go into these interactions and the internal forces present in a blade, we should explain the structure of each grass blade. The structure is derived from our main paper of reference.<br><br>
  Each grass blade consists of four point masses, and three line segments are rendered between these four points. The first point on each blade of grass is the root, and its position never changes. The roots are all situated along an xz plane. Extending upward from the root are the three other points, each an equal distance apart. The static state of a grass blade is for it to be pointed straight up, in the y direction.<br><br>
  Each of the three line segments contain an associated collection vectors. First, there is the vector <b>E<sub>e</sub></b>, which is the vector from one point of a segment to the other; the direction is always from root to tip. Second, we have an arbitrarily determined orthogonal vector called <b>E<sub>w</sub></b>. E<sub>w</sub> is the direction that our flat leaf surface will extend out to from our point masses. Lastly, we have a normalized vector <b>E<sub>n</sub></b> that is orthogonal to both E<sub>e</sub> and E<sub>w</sub>. The wind force will affect the segments in the E<sub>n</sub> direction, perpendicular to the leaf surface. For each point mass i, that is not a root, we then have:
  <div style="text-indent: 2em">
  <code>Vector3D E_e = point_masses[i].position - point_masses[i - 1].position;</code>
  </div>
  <div style="text-indent: 2em">
  <code>Vector3D E_w = cross(E_e, arbitraryVectorNonCollinear);</code>
  </div>
  <div style="text-indent: 2em">
  <code>Vector3D E_n = normalize(cross(E_e, E_w));</code>
  </div><br>
</p>

    
<h3>Internal forces and how the wind force is exerted on the grass</h3>
<p>
  The wind force is applied to the grass segment along the vector E<sub>n</sub> that we defined above. There was somewhat of a trade-off made here, since a perfectly perpendicular wind angle to E<sub>n</sub> will cause the grass not to move at all. However, if we wanted to render the grass with quad surfaces rather than straight lines, we needed to define a normal, and we needed the wind to affect the normal in directional consistency with the rendered quads. Ultimately, we decided to have the wind affect the blades in the direction of the normal. So, the wind force ultimately exerted on the blade at each time step is:
  <div style="text-indent: 2em">
  <code>dot(E_n, windForce) * E_n;</code>
  </div><br>
  There are also internal forces that act on our blade of grass. We add a restoration force to the net force acting on a point mass.<br><br>
  <div style="text-indent: 2em">
  <code>Vector3D restoration = stiffnessCoefficient * cross(angularDisplacement, currentPositionToStaticPosition);</code>
  </div><br>
  We will discuss how to calculate angular displacement in the next section, but it begins at 0. The vector pointing from the current to the static position of a point mass guides the point mass back to its original state. The stiffness coefficient simply determines the strength of this restoration force -- the higher it is, the lesser the effect of a displacing force (i.e wind). The stiffness also varies on a single blade and decreases from root to tip; this gives our blade a bending shape that we would see in real grass. We also have a damping force that acts opposite the direction of the angular velocity and gives an oscillating effect to the grass.<br><br>
  <div style="text-indent: 2em">
  <code>Vector3D damping = -dampingCoefficient * angularVelocity;</code>
  </div><br> Once again, these forces derived primarily from reference 1.
</p>

<h3>Calculating angular displacement</h3>
<p>
  Our ultimate goal is calculate <b>angular displacement</b> caused by the net force and use it to rotate the point mass. This angular displacement is the displacement from the static grass to its current angle about the root. This is how our blades actually move. We use Euler integration to obtain values for angular velocity and displacement, and we use an approximation for angular acceleration to allow us to do this integration. Our basic Euler integration method for determining the angular displacement of a point mass i looks similar to this: <br>
  <div style="text-indent: 2em">
  <code>Vector3D angularVelocity = previousVelocities[i] + angularAcceleration * delta_t;</code>
  </div>
  <div style="text-indent: 2em">
  <code>Vector3D angularDisplacement = angularVelocity * delta_t + 0.5 * angularAcceleration * delta_t * delta_t;</code>
  </div><br>
  Our approximation for <b>angular acceleration</b> is obtained by dividing the torque by the moment of inertia.<br><br>
  <div style="text-indent: 2em">
  <code>Vector3D torque = cross(E_e, point_masses[i].forces);</code>
  </div>
  <div style="text-indent: 2em">
  <code>double inertia = mass * segmentLength * segmentLength;</code>
  </div>
  <div style="text-indent: 2em">
  <code>Vector3D angularAcceleration = torque / inertia;</code>
  </div><br>
</p>

<h3>How we rotate based on angular displacement</h3>
<p>
  When we initially rotated the points, we were rotating them around the next point closest to the root, but we found there were imprecisions in the calculations that added up over timesteps. Instead, we rotate around the static root. First, we translate the point we wish to rotate; we bring it to the origin by subtracting the root position from the point's position vector. Then, we perform 3D rotations based on the angular displacement, using the standard 3D displacement matrices for each axis. We rotate around the X axis, then Y axis, then Z axis. Once the 3 rotations are complete, we translate again by adding the root position to the rotated vector.
</p>

<h3>Wind origin rectangle rendering</h3>
<p>
  All previous parts occur in the grass simulation functions; this step occurs in the shader function. There is a red rectangle that appears as the user changes the wind angle. The rectangle is there to visualize the direction from which the wind is traveling. To render this rectangle, we plotted points along the tangent of the wind angle. Then, we rotated these values by 90 degrees about the wind origin such that the plane they formed faced the grass. Then, we filled in the points as a triangle strip.
</p>

<h3> Shader Pipeline
<p>
  Once we had the four points for each blade of grass and its movement according to the wind acting on it, we had to provide these blades their appearance. Aside from the usual vertex shader feeding outputs into the fragment shader, this time we have a geometry shader in between the two aforementioned shaders in order to "expand" the edges between the points of a blade and provide body to the blade. 
  First, a new drawGrass function is made which feeds the blade's four points and edge widths (e_w) as input to the vertex shader for each blade in the scene. For each blade, a GL_LINE_STRIP_ADJACENCYprimitive is rendered (so we may pass four points into the geometry shader later).

  From the vertex shader, we simply pass through its inputs to the geometry shader and do not perform and change of basis. This is because we do not want to transform the points to model space or screen space until after we have created the new points and edges within the geometry shader.

  Now, within the geometry shader is where we expand the edges of the line representing each blade. Each point is expanded by the length of its edge width (e_w) in both directions (adding and subtracting this length) multiplied by a small constant factor dependent on where the point lies on this blade. Points higher up on the blade have a smaller factor so that when used to expand the point, will narrow down from root to tip. Once these points have been created, their positions are left multiplied by the model's transformation and view projection transformation to visualize these primitives onto the screen. As a result, this geometry shader will create a total of 8 points and render these as a triangle_strip primitive, outputting these points to the fragment shader to be colored/textured.  
  Finally, the fragment shader simply takes these points from the geometry shader and colors them based on the color given from the nanogui (u_color).
</p>

<h3>Problems encountered</h3>
<p>
  We encountered a few problems throughout the project. The first issue was getting to know the skeleton beyond what we needed to know for project 4. The biggest hurdle in the project was what might seem like the simplest task: getting a barebones, unsimulated, vertical grass blade rendered on the screen. This was simply due to us needing to get acquianted with unfamiliar parts of the skeleton. Another issue we faced is that we had two separate major tasks. One of them was modeling the grass, which our main point of reference is almost entirely based on. The other problem was creating the wind field, which we initially planned to build using fluid dynamics. However, we realized that fluid dynamics are quite complicated (and many people work solely on fluids for their final project), so we eventually scrapped the implementation for the simpler wind load approach. We faced a few technical issues as well. In the section about bending within reference 1, the authors discuss a scenario in which segments of the blade move in opposite directions, causing erratic blade shapes/movements. We ran into this issue at high velocities with rapid angle changes, and the paper proposes a solution, but we did not have time to implement it. Time constraints also limited us to the bending effects of grass, leaving the twisting and swinging effects to be implemented. 
  Similarly, implementing the shader pipeline with our starting code proved difficult. Navigating the code base took more time than expected in order to work on this portion, and there was also not much information online for us to adopt the same ideas to our codebase. The paper which we based much of our grass implementation on did not dive deeply into the implementation of the shader pipeline and and was moreso a general scope of the process. Therefore, Steven had to play around for a few days figuring out how to work with geometry shaders and incorporating it into the shader pipeline that was present at the starting point. This shader pipeline took more effort and time than we had initially anticipated and in retrospect we should have delved deeper into it from the beginning. All in all, playing around and reading documentation was the best way to make progress in regards to this section of our program.
  Aside from these technical challenges, one of our other tough and unavoidable hurdles were a result of two of our team members being sick from COVID. This affected much of our roadmap and we had to adapt with slight changes in scope to an extent which still did not damage the integrity of our original goals. From these complications, we were not able to get much work done during the weeks which it occurred, however we were still able to discuss our implementation and try to keep each other up-to-date on the current objectives to be met.
</p>

<h3>Lessons learned</h3>
<p>
  We could have simplified our project by implementing different libraries or skeletons, in addition to those included in project 4. For example, we could have narrowed in on the grass implementation by using a pre-existing fluid dynamics wind simulation. On the other hand, we could have focused solely on fluid-based wind simulation and applied it to a pre-existing grass structure. We implemented parts of two different problems in order to obtain our end results, but maybe we could have abstracted away one of the problems and focused more intently on the other. We also learned about dealing with movement and rotation in 3 dimensions. At one point in our simulation, we built out the Rodrigues rotation formula, and we experimented with various axes of rotation for the point masses. We learned that three-dimensional rotation can get complicated quickly. We also explored the trade-offs in various forms of integration, looking mainly at Verlet integration (because we implemented it in project 4) and Euler integration (which was recommended in a referenced paper, and which we ended up using).

  Orion: Helped work on the set up of the assignment for the team to be able to pull the project, and build it. Helped figure out how shaders are handled in the GUI in clothSimulator.cpp and clothSimulator.h for collision objects, and implemented constant shading of the grass collision object. However, informed on how collision objects differed from the main cloth object, helped make the decision to not make grass a collision object and build the grass in place of the cloth by editing cloth.cpp/h and clothsimulator.cpp/h. Helped delete code related to springs since grass would need different physics than cloth. Helped edit buildGrid within cloth.cpp in order to create the grid of point masses known as the grass. Helped render the original grass in drawWireFrame in clothSimulator.cpp with figuring out how OpenGL worked. Set up a layout for the final presentation. Large credit to Justin where we worked together on most the parts I worked on, and he was a huge help in figuring out the majority of the bugs we were working on/stuck on for hours.

  Jonathan: Tried helping during the debugging process of the grass implementation after the wind field was implemented by Justin. Assisted Steven with the implementation of the frag and vert files. Unfortunately couldn't contribute much to the implementation due to Covid-19 and most time was spend trying to understanding changes made to the code and debugging if problems still existed.
